Morte is a multi-architecture LaaS designed to fit into different systems. Its main function is to prepare the environment after an initial access in order to deploy the binary that best fits the affected infrastructure, execute the loader, and set it up to perform botnet functions, mining, or whatever the LaaS affiliate decides. The business model relies on customers being able to use the zombie machines for their benefit, to run DDoS tasks, mining, or to pivot into infrastructure already compromised, and it can also serve as an access point for ransomware operators
